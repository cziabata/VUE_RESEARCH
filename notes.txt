- v-model - used for two-way binding (example - input+value)
- {{ }} - used for interpolation, for text only
- v-on:click=" " || @click - event handler
- v-on:keydown.enter=" " - event handler with modificator
- v-bind:key=" " || :key - directive for unique keys
- <template></template> - use like Fragment in React, often used with v-if directive
- :class - directive for conditional css class

### structural directives ###

- v-for=" " - used for array map, work like JS cycle 'for of'
- v-if=" " - delete html element if expression falsy

### lifecycle hooks

- computed() - work like methods() but in this case Vue cached computed calls. Computed call when one of this.something 
which using inside computed has changed. Computeds using like fields (without ()). In computed you cannot assign 
component data (for example, from a data hook). A computed can be any expression that makes a calculation, does not 
change the data, and the result of which is used in the template

- data() - the date hook cannot contain fields that can be calculated based on the current state 
(time code 38:00, lesson 17, Illya Klymov). 

- watch() - used for logic that depends on the results of other parts of the component. Each watch behind 
the scenes takes two parameters - prevValue, nextValue
